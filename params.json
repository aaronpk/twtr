{"name":"Twtr.io","tagline":"Algorithmic Twitter URL shortener","body":"twtr.io\r\n=======\r\n\r\ntwtr.io is an algorithmic URL shortener for Twitter URLs.\r\n\r\nGiven a full URL to a tweet such as https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/364781641031360514, this can be shortened to http://twtr.io/bBowYg3hMu. When the short URL is requested, it is algorithmically expanded to a twitter.com URL. Since the shortening is done algorithmically, no database is needed, and the requirements for running this code are very small. \r\n\r\nTry it Now!\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n<form action=\"/shorten\" method=\"get\">\r\nTweet URL: <input type=\"text\" name=\"url\">\r\n<input type=\"button\" value=\"Make Shorter!\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"format\" value=\"html\">\r\n</form>\r\n\r\n\r\nShortening\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe base 10 tweet ID is converted to a [NewBase60](http://ttk.me/w/NewBase60) number to compress it. The ID is appended to \"http://twtr.io/\" forming the shortened URL for the tweet.\r\n\r\n\r\nUn-Shortening\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTo un-shorten a link, the NewBase60 number is converted back to its base 10 equivalent. The base 10 ID is appended to \"https://twitter.com/_/status/\". This takes advantage of a feature of twitter.com where they will redirect a tweet URL to the correct username.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 by Aaron Parecki\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
